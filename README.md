# Visitors-System-
The Visitors System is a web-based application designed to manage and monitor visitors in a university residence environment. It provides a structured way to register, track, and control access for guests visiting students, ensuring better organization, accountability, and security within the residence.
The system allows residents to log visitor details, while administrators or residence staff can view, verify, and manage visitor records in real time. By keeping all visitor information in a centralized database, the platform reduces manual paperwork and improves efficiency in handling guest access.
This project focuses on building a reliable and user-friendly solution that supports visitor registration, monitoring, and record management, making it easier for residences to maintain safety and operational control.
